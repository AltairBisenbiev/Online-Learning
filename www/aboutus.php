	<h2 class="text-success">STUDENT QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
	<p class="text-justify">A grade-point average of 2.33 on a scale of 4.0 (C+) or better. To qualify for the program, students must submit school transcripts for the current and three previous academic years. CIEE translates their course grades into the U.S. grading system to establish their performance. Grades that recently have dropped adversely affect eligibility and placement.
Completion of each school year with passing grades.
At least three years of studying English in an academic environment without failing a class.
The ability to understand and speak English. Each participant is administered a Standard English test before their application. The recommended test is the SLEP and a score of 38 or higher is required. We also accept the Michigan Test with a score of 63 or higher.</p>
